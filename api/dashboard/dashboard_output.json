                "summary": "After Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole address hinted at a possible rate cut in September, Indian equity benchmarks were set for a higher Monday open. Gift Nifty traded at a premium of around 55 points over Nifty futures, reflecting optimism in global markets. The backdrop of a dovish US Fed stance provided a tailwind, even as the previous session snapped a six-day winning run.",

                "summary": "Technically, the 50-day simple moving average near 81,900 on the Sensex has become a pivotal support-cum-resistance zone. A sustained move above this level could pave the way for a rally toward the next hurdle at 82,500 and potentially extend gains to 83,300. Conversely, failure to hold 81,900 may trigger a deeper retracement down to the 20-day SMA around 81,100–81,000 or even the 80,700–80,400 band.",

Strong domestic liquidity, buoyed by mutual fund inflows, offset some of the selling, and selective company-specific news in consumer and capex-led counters triggered pockets of buying, resulting in a narrow-range trading session."
