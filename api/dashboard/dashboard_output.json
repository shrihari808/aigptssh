The BSE Sensex jumped over 330 points to 80,143.59, and the Nifty 50 climbed 84.45 points to 24,511.30, as investors balanced optimism over domestic resilience with lingering global trade tensions.",

Institutional flows stayed subdued as investors awaited fresh catalysts, though sectoral shifts—selling pressure in metal and IT stocks—were partly cushioned by steady buying in FMCG and banking names. Currency traders tracked a modest rupee slide alongside a dip in crude futures on lower supply‐risk fears. Specific corporate news, including Bajaj Auto’s 5% jump in August sales driven by strong exports and Lloyds Metals commissioning its new sponge‐iron plant, offered sporadic pockets of optimism amid a broadly risk‐averse tone."
