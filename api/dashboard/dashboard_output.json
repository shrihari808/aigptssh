        "summary": "Today’s Indian market slipped into a cautious mood as weak global cues – led by a US federal appeals court upholding Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, softer US inflation data and lower Asian bourses – weighed on sentiment in the absence of clear domestic triggers. Investors remained on the sidelines ahead of the GST Council meeting, where talks over potential rate rationalization and broader GST reforms are expected to set the next policy tone, while foreign institutional flows stayed subdued. Sectoral divergences were pronounced, with metal and IT names under pressure even as FMCG and banking stocks provided limited support, and farm‐linked sectors, including tractor makers buoyed by ICRA’s upbeat demand outlook, managed to hold ground. Technical indicators on Sensex and Nifty also signalled a negative bias, underscoring the need for clearer consolidation or fresh catalysts before participants step up risk exposure."
