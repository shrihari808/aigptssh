While strong domestic liquidity and talk of GST and tax reforms offered some underpinning, easing corporate earnings momentum and sluggish consumer spending capped upside. Sectorally, metals, realty and pharma led declines, even as FMCG stocks held up relatively well. In sum, a mix of global tariff jitters, FII outflows, earnings uncertainty and targeted sector weakness dictated the trading session’s subdued performance."
