The heightened trade tension exacerbated investor concerns over India’s export outlook and sparked a sector-wide sell-off, marking the sharpest contraction in Nifty 50 in three months.",

Foreign institutional outflows intensified the downtrend, offsetting strong domestic liquidity supported by falling interest rates and hopes of GST and broader tax reforms. Meanwhile, weak global cues—from lingering geopolitical uncertainty to murky tariff outcomes—kept investors cautious, making yesterday’s steep fall a story of external shocks, shifting institutional flows, and selective profit‐taking in bank and financial stocks."
