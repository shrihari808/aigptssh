                "summary": "After a brief correction, Indian benchmark indices staged a strong comeback last week, with the BSE Sensex rising 0.88% and both Sensex and Nifty closing the week with gains of around 1%. Midcap and smallcap segments outperformed as optimism around potential GST reforms and sustained domestic institutional investor buying helped markets recover from their recent corrective phase.",

                "summary": "Technically, the critical support for the Sensex lies at the 50-day SMA near 81,900, with a break below likely to test the 20-day SMA in the 81,100–81,000 zone and potentially dragging levels down to 80,700–80,400. On the upside, immediate resistance is in the 82,000–82,200 zone, with a decisive breakout above 82,500 opening the path toward 83,300. An indecisive ‘inside body’ daily candle further underscores choppy trading conditions.",

Although Monday saw the Sensex gain 329 points, the Nifty slipped below 24,900, and an inside candle formation points to uncertainty in the immediate session as investors assess the trade and geopolitical risks.",

Selling pressure was pronounced in banking and metals, yet the week ended on a positive note thanks to GST reform hopes and DII support.

Foreign institutional investors have also trimmed positions, largely on profit‐booking and portfolio rebalancing amid tariff uncertainty and global supply-chain concerns. While global cues and geopolitical stability remain watchpoints, a revival in consumer spending and a pickup in private sector investment are seen as the most likely catalysts for a sustainable up-move, with long-term gains ultimately hinging on steady macro fundamentals, earnings revival and attractive relative valuations."
