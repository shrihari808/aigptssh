Domestic technicals reinforced the bearish tone as the Nifty slipped below its key moving averages, while company-specific news—such as a discounted stake sale by an IndiGo co-founder weighing on InterGlobe Aviation and a rally in Ola Electric after its Gen-3 scooters secured certification—added to the volatility. Hopes for near-term policy support from upcoming GST reforms and other government measures offered only limited relief, leaving headline indices under sustained pressure."
