Sectoral underperformance among metals, realty and pharma stocks (notably Sun Pharma), along with a mid‐cap bias against risk ahead of a looming holiday, weighed on benchmarks, while defensive pockets like FMCG managed modest gains. Absent clearer catalysts on tariff clarity, GST reforms and a pick‐up in consumer spending and private investments, markets are expected to linger in a tight trading range."
