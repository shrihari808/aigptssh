                "summary": "The Indian stock market snapped its six-day winning run on Friday as indices fell sharply ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole address, with the Nifty 50 losing 213.65 points to close at 24,870.10 and the Sensex down 693.86 points to 81,306.85.

On the upside, sustained trading above 81,900 may trigger a fresh rally toward resistance zones at 82,500 and 83,300, guiding short-term trading strategies.",
